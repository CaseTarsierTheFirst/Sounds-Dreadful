# Meeting 6 Minutes

**Date** 30.9.25

**Location** In Person

**Minutes Writer** Penelope

## Attendees
- Penelope
- Peter

  ## Key Points Discussed
  - Have a fully function easy bpm version working! Within 10% range, though sometimes counts double and half time
  - Currently only working with static threshold (pass level)

  ## Steps Until Next Meeting
  - Penelope: Look over spectral flux modules and get them to at least compile (as no board to work on)
  - Peter: Test out easy bpm on different songs to identify potential pitfalls/issues that we've missed

  **Location:** Uni, PNR
